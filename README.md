Hello!  Welcome to CamlP4-Gadgets.  This is a work-in-progress, as I sort out one of CS's most poorly documented of projects.  You'll see I'm beginning to aggregate Jake Donham's blog entries on Ambassador To The Computers.  I'm also assimilating samples from INRIA and have included a 3.12 copy of the CamlP4 source code for a glorious Pygmented reference.

Interested in the project?  Contact me!  I love to write and I'd love to hear from you.
